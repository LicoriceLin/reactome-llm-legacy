    "origin='We compared interactions of nucleotide-free classical Rho proteins (RAC1G15A, RHOGG15A, CDC42G15A and RHOAG17A) and their WT forms (Fig. 2a). In all but one case, the nucleotide-free form interacted with more GEFs than the WT protein. Some GEFs displayed specificity for one of the baits, which recapitulates previous reports as follows. RHOAG17A interacted with the RHOAspecific GEFs ARHGEF1 (ref. 25), ARHGEF2 (ref. 26), ARHGEF5 (ref. 27), ARHGEF17 (ref. 28), NGEF29, ECT2 (ref. 30) and AKAP13 (ref.31) (Fig. 2a). RAC1G15A bound the RAC1-specific GEFs SWAP70 (ref. 32), DOCK1 (refs. 33,34), DOCK4 (ref. 35), DOCK5 (ref. 36) and DOCK6 (ref. 37). Finally, CDC42G15A interacted with the CDC42- specific GEFs DNMBP38, PLEKHG1 (ref. 39), DOCK8 (ref. 40) and DOCK10 (ref. 41) (Fig. 2a). BioID confirmed the reported broad selectivity of some GEFs as follows: VAV2 (ref. 42) for RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42; TRIO43 for RHOA, RAC1 and RHOG; ARHGEF11 (ref.44) for RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42; DOCK7 (ref. 45) for RAC1 and CDC42; ARHGEF7 (ref. 46) for RAC1 and CDC42; FARP1 (ref. 47) for RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42; and BCR48 for RHOA and RAC1 (Fig. 2a). We detected an interaction between CDC42G15A and ARHGEF26, which is believed to be a RHOG-specific GEF. Notably, the initial studies of ARHGEF26 reported activity towards CDC42 (ref. 49). While we found that RHOAG17A interacted with its established GEF ARHGEF12 (ref. 50), an interaction with CDC42G15A was also detected (Fig. 2a), which suggests that it may have broader activity than reported. PLEKHG3 is validated as a RAC1 and CDC42 GEF51, and our BioID data confirmed this specificity, but also revealed binding to RHOA. We experimentally confirmed that PLEKHG3 interacts with nucleotide-free RHOA, which suggests that it is also a RHOA GEF (Fig. 2b). Hence, nucleotide-free Rho baits are effective for uncovering the GEFs that regulate them.'\n",
